        <p>These Vietnamese spring rolls are a refreshing change from the usual fried variety and have become a 
        family favorite. They are a great summertime appetizer and delicious dipped in one or both of the sauces.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon white suger</li>
            <li>4 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic chilli sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped peanuts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in vermicelli pasta and 
                return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender yet firm to 
                the bite, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fill a large bowl with warm water. Dip one wrapper into the hot water for 1 second to soften. Lay 
                wrapper flat; place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center, add some vermicelli, lettuce, mint,
                 cilantro, and basil, leaving about 2 inches uncovered on each side. Fold uncovered sides inward, 
                 then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with lettuce. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>For the sauces: Mix water, lime juice, sugar, fish sauce, garlic, and chili sauce in a small bowl 
                until well combined. Mix hoisin sauce and peanuts in a separate small bowl.</li>
            <li>Serve rolled spring rolls with fish sauce and hoisin sauce mixtures.</li>
        </ol>
